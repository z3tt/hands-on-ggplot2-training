## The `{ggplot2}` Package

> `{ggplot2}` is a system for declaratively creating graphics,<br>based on "The Grammar of Graphics" (Wilkinson, 2005).
> You provide the data, tell `{ggplot2}` how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

### Advantages of `{ggplot2}`

* consistent underlying grammar of graphics (Wilkinson, 2005)
* very flexible, layered plot specification 
* theme system for polishing plot appearance
* active and helpful community

### The Package

`ggplot2` is a **data visualization package** for the programming language `R` created by Hadley Wickham.

It should be already installed on your system (if not run the first line in the following chunk). The functionality of the package can be loaded by calling `library()` as for any other package:

```{r ggplot-package, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

`ggplot2` is part of the [`tidyverse` package collection](https://www.tidyverse.org/). Thus, you can also load `tidyverse` without running `library(ggplot2)`:

```{r tidyverse-package}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```


## The Data Set

We use **cryptocurrency financial data**, pulled from [CoinMarketCap.com](https://www.kaggle.com/philmohun/cryptocurrency-financial-data).
For our purposes, we limit the data to the period 08/2017–12/2019 and the top 4 cryptocurrencies.

I have already prepared the data. If you want to know how, you can have a look [here]().

### Import the Data

Using the `read_csv()` function from the `{readr}` package, we can read the data directly from the web:

```{r data-readr}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/hands-on-ggplot2/main/data/crypto_cleaned.csv"

data <- readr::read_csv(url)

data
```

Of course, one can import local files as well:

```{r data-readr-local}
data_local <- readr::read_csv("data/crypto_cleaned.csv")

data_local
```

This assumes that you have placed the file in a folder called `data` in your working directory.  
You can specify this directory via `setwd()` or, and preferably, use R projects.


#### Short Explanation of ::

The so–called **namespace** allows to access functions from a package directly without loading it first.

`packagename::function(argument)`

Furthermore, it helps readers to understand from which package a function is imported from.

## Exercise 1

* Import the data set on Chicago weather data:<br>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/ggplot-courses/master/data/chicago-nmmaps.csv
* Inspect the data.

## The Grammar of Graphics

### The Structure of ggplot2

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/hands-on-ggplot2/main/slides/img/structure-table.png)


### Data: ggplot(data)

We need to specify the data in the `ggplot()` call:

```{r structure-data}
ggplot(data = data)
```

There is only an empty panel because `ggplot2` doesn't know **what** of the data it should plot.

### Aesthetics: aes()

We need to specify two variables we want to plot as positional `aes`thetics:

```{r structure-aes}
ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = date, y = close))
```

There is only an empty panel because `ggplot2` doesn't know **how** it should plot the data.

Thanks to implicit matching of arguments in `ggplot()` and `aes()`, we can also write:

```{r structure-aes-implicit}
ggplot(data, aes(date, close))
```


### Layers: geom_\*() and stat_*()

By adding one or multiple layers we can tell `ggplot2` *how* to represent the data.
There are lots of built-in geometric elements (`geom's`) and statistical transformations (`stat's`):

![Adapted from ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/hands-on-ggplot2/main/slides/img/ggplot-layers.png)

We can tell `ggplot2` to represent the data for example as a **scatter plot**:

```{r structure-geom-point}
ggplot(data, aes(date, close)) +
  geom_point()
```


### Aesthetics: aes() (again)

Aesthetics do not only refer to x and y positions, but also groupings, colors, fills, shapes etc.

```{r structure-aes-line-colors}
ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = date, y = close, color = currency)) +
  geom_point()
```


### Important Things First: Change the Default Theme

You can replace the default theme with one of the other built-in themes with `theme_set()`.
Note that you can as well adjust some global settings, for example the `base_size` which is often too small in the default (11).

```{r theme}
theme_set(theme_light(base_size = 18))
```

By using `theme_set()` the new theme is used for any plot you create aftwerwards! Give it a try on go back to the last chunk and re-run the code to generate the colored scatter plot.


### Layers: geom_\*() and stat_*() (repeated)

The exciting thing about layers is that you can combine several `geom_*()` and `stat_*()` calls:

```{r structure-geom-point-smooth}
ggplot(data, aes(date, close, color = currency)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

... and aesthetics can be applied either **globally**:

```{r structure-geom-point-smooth-aes-global}
ggplot(data, aes(date, close, color = currency, shape = currency)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

... or for each layer **individually**:

```{r structure-geom-point-smooth-aes-individual}
ggplot(data, aes(date, close)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = currency)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = currency))
```

---

## Exercise 2

* If needed, import the Chicago weather data again:

```{r import-chic-again}
chic <- readr::read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/ggplot-courses/master/data/chicago-nmmaps.csv"
)
```

* Create a scatter plot of temperature (`temp`) versus day (`date`).
* Color the points by season (`season`).
* Color the points by year (`year`).
  + What's the problem? How could you fix it?
* **Bonus:** Turn the scatter plot, colored by season, into a line plot.
  + What's the problem? How could you fix it?


## Saving a `ggplot`

You can export your plot via the `ggsave()` function:

```{r ggsave, eval=FALSE}
ggsave(filename = "my_ggplot.pdf", 
       width = 10, height = 7, 
       device = cairo_pdf)

ggsave(filename = "my_ggplot.png", 
       width = 10, height = 7, 
       dpi = 700)
```

## Appendix

### Import the Data

#### The `{here}` Package

A good workflow when working with local files is offered by the `{here}` package in combination with R projects:

```{r data-readr-local-here}
here::here()

data_local <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data", "crypto_cleaned.csv"))

data_local
```

#### Base R

The base R function `read.csv()` works in the same way as `readr::read_csv()`:

```{r data-base}
data <- read.csv(here::here("data", "crypto_cleaned.csv"))

head(data)
```

... and we can turn it into a **tibble** afterwards:

```{r data-base-tbl}
data <- tibble::as_tibble(data)

data
```

However, note that by default the date column is runed into type `character`.


#### The {rio} Package

The `import()` function from the `{rio}` package allows to load all kind of data formats:

```{r data-rio-url}
#install.packages("rio")

data <- rio::import(here::here("data", "crypto_cleaned.csv"))

head(data) ## use just head because the output is very long
```

We can turn it into a **tibble** afterwards—or specify it directly when importing the data set:

```{r data-rio-tbl}
data <- rio::import(here::here("data", "crypto_cleaned.csv"), setclass = "tbl")

data
```

You could also load, for example, JSON or Excel files with the same function:

```{r data-rio-json}
data_json <- rio::import(here::here("data", "crypto_cleaned.json"))

data_json <- as_tibble(data_json) ## somehow `setclass` doesn't work with json

data_json
```

```{r data-rio-xlsx}
data_xlsx <- rio::import(
  here::here("data", "crypto_cleaned.xlsx"),
  setclass = "tbl"
)

data_xlsx
```

We can remove the first column by using the `select()` function from the `{dplyr}` package:

```{r data-xlsx-select}
data_xlsx <- dplyr::select(data_xlsx, -1)
#data_xlsx <- dplyr::select(data_xlsx, currency:yday)

data_xlsx
```

---

### Aesthetics: aes()

Some prefer to place the `aes()` outside the `ggplot()` call:

```{r structure-aes-outside}
ggplot(data) +
  aes(x = date, y = close)
```



### Coordinate Systems: coord_*()

The coordinate system maps the two position to a 2d position on the plot:

```{r structure-coord}
ggplot(data, aes(x = date, y = close, 
                 color = currency)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_date() + 
  scale_y_continuous() + 
  scale_color_discrete() +
  coord_cartesian()
```

```{r structure-coord-polar}
ggplot(data, aes(x = date, y = close, 
                 color = currency)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_date() + 
  scale_y_continuous() + 
  scale_color_discrete() +
  coord_polar()
```

Changing the limits on the coordinate system allows to zoom in:

```{r structure-coord-zoom}
ggplot(data, aes(x = date, y = close, 
                 color = currency)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_date() + 
  scale_y_continuous() + 
  scale_color_discrete() +
  coord_cartesian(
    xlim = c(as.Date("2018-11-01"),
             as.Date("2019-11-01")),
    ylim = c(NA, 100)
  )
```
